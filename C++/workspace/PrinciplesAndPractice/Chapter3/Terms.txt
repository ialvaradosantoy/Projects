Chapter 3 terms
1. Assignment
  - Setting a variable's value to a desired value
2. cin
  - Standard input stream known as "Character input" defined
    in the C++ standard library
  - Interpreted as "see-in"
3. Concatenation
  - String operation that combines a string's character sequence
    to additional character sequence(s)
4. Conversion
  - Change of a variable type value to another variable type value
  - ex: char vairable value to an int variable value
5. declaration
  - Statement that gives a name to an object
6. decrement
  - Short hand notation to substract 1 from of a value
  - --number -> number = number -1
7. definition
  - A declaration that sets aside memory for an object
8. increment
  - Short hand notation to add 1 to a value
  - ++num -> num = num +1
9. initialization
  - inital value assignment to a variable
10. name
  - Name chosen for a declared variable 
11. narrowing
  - implicitly turning a value into a value of antoher type that
    does not equal the origanl value, known as an unsafe conversion
12. object
  - Place in memory that holds a value of a given type
13. operation
  - Allowed commands that can be executed on a variable type using operators
    or named functions
14. operator
  - Direct operations that can be used to modify variables
  - ex: common arithmetic operators , *, /, +,-
15. type
  - defines a set of possible values and a set of operations (for an object)
  - int, double, char, bool, string
16. type safety
  - Only using objects according to the rules for their type
17. value
  - memory representation of data through bits
  - interpreted according to a type
18. variable
  - A named object
