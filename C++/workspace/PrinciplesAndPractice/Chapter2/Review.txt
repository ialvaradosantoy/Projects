1. What is the purpose of the "Hello, World!" program?
    - To set up projects, source files, development environment, and get aquainted
      with the compiler error-detection & and error-reporting facilities.
2. Name the four parts of a function.
    - a return type, a name, a parameter list, and a function body
3. Name a function that must appear in every C++ program.
    - a main function
4. In the "Hello, World!" program, what is the purpose of the line return 0;?
    - It is the return type of the main function, on Windows the value is not used
      since the main function is called by "the system". Where as on unix/linux, it 
      can be used to check whether the program succeeded. Return of "0", indicates
      the program terminated successfully.
5. What is the purpose of the compiler?
    - The compiler is a program that converts source code/text into machine readable code,
      namely an executable/object code/machine code.
6. What is the purpose of the #include directive?
    - The #include directive instructs the computer to make available facilities from a file (i.e header file),
7. What does a .h suffix at the end of a file name signify in C++?
    - This signifys a header file that has function definitions. They can be included into source files for using
      the functions without having to write the functions in every file.
8. What does the linker do for your program?
    - The linker combines the object code created from source file and respective include directives to create an 
      executable program that can ran with the intended requirements.
9. What is the difference between a source file and an object file?
    - The source file is the human readable file created by a human, and an object file is the generated machine 
      readble file from a source file being compiled.
10. What is an IDE and what does it do for you?
    - An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, and it consists of an editor and many features for making
      program creation easier. Such as color coding of text to disntiguish syntax with respect to the programming
      language being used. It also contains many helpful tools for debugging, compiling, and executing programs.
11. If you understand everything in the textbook, why is it neccessary to practice?
    - Programming is like any skill-based craft, so practicing helps maintain a high level practical skill and 
      develop/reinforce good programming habbits.
